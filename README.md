# What?

Meem is a command-line tool to create memes.

# How?

    $ meem good-guy-greg --top "makes memes" --bottom "saves to disk"
    /tmp/meme.jpg

    $ meem good-guy-greg --top "makes memes" --bottom "uploads to imgur" | imgur

Meem comes with a bunch of templates, but you can add your own in `~/.meem`.

# Why?

There are already a few meme generators out there, but they don't work. This one does.

# Installation

    $ gem install meem
